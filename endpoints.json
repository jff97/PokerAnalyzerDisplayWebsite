It is a standard deviation value from statistics.</li><li>🃏 <strong>Adjusted Ranking:</strong> Your TrueSkill rating minus 3 times your uncertainty. This accounts for TrueSkill's uncertainty about your skill level and creates a fair ranking for players with both few and many rounds played. Your uncertainty goes down with more rounds played.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Your TrueSkill score is a <strong>relative skill estimate</strong>, not a point total or winning percentage. A higher rank indicates a stronger player, but it's not a direct measure of any one stat.</p>"
